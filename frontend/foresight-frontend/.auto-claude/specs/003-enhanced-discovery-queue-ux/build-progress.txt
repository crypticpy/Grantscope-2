Project: Enhanced Discovery Queue UX
Workspace: .auto-claude/specs/003-enhanced-discovery-queue-ux
Started: 2024-12-24

Workflow Type: feature
Rationale: New feature enhancement adding UI/UX capabilities (keyboard shortcuts, gestures, quick actions, undo) to existing discovery queue system. Introduces new interaction patterns beyond simple refactoring.

Session 1 (Planner):
- Created implementation_plan.json
- Phases: 7
- Total subtasks: 11
- Created init.sh
- Created context.json

Phase Summary:
- Phase 1 (Infrastructure Setup): 1 subtask - Install react-hotkeys-hook and @use-gesture/react
- Phase 2 (UI Components): 2 subtasks - Create Toast and Progress wrapper components
- Phase 3 (Keyboard Navigation): 2 subtasks - Create useKeyboardShortcuts hook, integrate j/k navigation
- Phase 4 (Quick Actions Enhancement): 2 subtasks - Add swipe gestures, add f/d keyboard shortcuts
- Phase 5 (Progress Indicator): 1 subtask - Add progress bar to DiscoveryQueue
- Phase 6 (Undo Functionality): 2 subtasks - Create useUndoStack hook, integrate undo with toast
- Phase 7 (Integration & Polish): 1 subtask - Edge case handling and debouncing

Services Involved:
- Frontend (React/TypeScript/Vite): Primary service - all UI enhancements happen here

Parallelism Analysis:
- Max parallel phases: 2 (Phase 5 and Phase 6 can run in parallel)
- Recommended workers: 1 (most subtasks modify DiscoveryQueue.tsx sequentially)
- Parallel subtasks:
  - subtask-2-1 and subtask-2-2 (Toast and Progress components)
  - subtask-5-1 and subtask-6-1 (Progress indicator and undo hook)
- Speedup estimate: Sequential execution recommended

Key Implementation Details:
- Install only 2 new packages: react-hotkeys-hook, @use-gesture/react
- Radix UI (Toast, Progress) already installed - just need wrapper components
- Existing API functions in discovery-api.ts support all needed operations
- DiscoveryQueue.tsx already has card display and action handlers
- Pattern: useState/useCallback for local state management
- Styling: Tailwind CSS with dark mode variants

Critical Gotchas Documented:
- MUST set touchAction: 'none' on swipeable elements
- MUST use dependency arrays in useHotkeys to avoid stale closures
- MUST set preventDefault: true to avoid browser shortcut conflicts
- Undo window limited to 5 seconds to prevent stale state issues

=== STARTUP COMMAND ===

To continue building this spec, run:

  source auto-claude/.venv/bin/activate && python auto-claude/run.py --spec 003 --parallel 1

Example:

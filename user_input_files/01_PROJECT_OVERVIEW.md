# Foresight: Project Overview

## What Is Foresight?

Foresight is a strategic horizon scanning system for the City of Austin. It automates the discovery, analysis, and tracking of emerging trends, technologies, and issues that could impact municipal operations 6-36 months in the future.

## The Problem

City employees are in reactive mode—fighting daily fires with no capacity for forward-looking strategic analysis. Only well-funded cities can afford dedicated foresight teams. Austin needs a force multiplier.

## The Solution

An AI-powered system that:
1. **Scans** news, research, and publications nightly for relevant emerging issues
2. **Synthesizes** findings into digestible "Cards" (atomic units of intelligence)
3. **Tracks** how topics evolve through maturity stages over time
4. **Enables** users to follow topics relevant to their work
5. **Analyzes** implications of trends for Austin-specific context

## Core Concept: Cards

Everything in Foresight is a **Card**. A card represents a single emerging concept, technology, or trend.

Cards have:
- A name and AI-generated summary
- Classification (pillar, horizon, maturity stage)
- Source lineage (all articles that informed it)
- Evolution history (how it's changed over time)
- Followers (users tracking it)
- Implications analyses (what it means for Austin)

Think of cards like "Pokémon cards for strategic intelligence"—users collect and follow the ones relevant to their work.

## Target Users

- **Primary:** 30-40 city staff across departments involved in strategic planning
- **Secondary:** Department leadership, council briefing preparers
- **Tertiary:** Any city employee curious about emerging trends

## Alignment

Foresight aligns with:
- City of Austin Citywide Strategic Plan (CSP)
- CMO's Top 25 Priorities
- Budget & Organizational Excellence (BOE) 2025 Foresight Roadmap
- Framework Foresight methodology (Hines & Bishop)

## Success Metrics

- Number of cards created and tracked
- User engagement (follows, analyses run)
- Cards cited in strategic planning documents
- Time saved vs. manual research
- Stage transitions detected before mainstream awareness

## Project Status

**Phase:** Architecture & Design
**Target:** Pilot with 5-10 users from selected departments
**Timeline:** TBD
